What is the difference between manually scarping data and using an automated web scraper?

Manually collecting data:

- Takes a long time
- Very boring and menial task
- Once you start to fatigue, you start missing things and making mistakes
- You could be doing something you actually enjoy
_ You could be focusing your energy on something that you are good at

Automated script collecting data:

- Not only is it quicker, but as you add more data it saves time exponentially 
- Once the web scraper has been coded and tested properly, it will make no mistakes
- Frees up your time to get on with something else
- Can be used again and again or even scheduled to perform the same task over and over
- Can be made into a scalable app that has multiple
